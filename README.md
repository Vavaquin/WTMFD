WT MFD is a Google Chrome extension that provides flight information for the game "Warthunder" in a practical and simple manner.

The extension is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The information is collected from the localhost provided by Warthunder and processed by a script that smooths the data transition, ensuring fluid updates even with a 300ms refresh rate, giving the impression of faster updates.

Additionally, the extension uses the map provided by the localhost, slightly adapted to fit the concept of the extension.

The MFD panels are interactive, allowing the information displayed to be alternated, just like in real life.

No configuration is necessary to use the extension. Simply download it from the Google Web Store and open the extension while in the game. The only required action is to press "sync" at each respawn to ensure the information is updated.
